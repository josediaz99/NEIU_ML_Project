- what is / does the data try to explain
- what information is necessary for our system to better understand if we are under a dos attack
- what can be removed or refactored and why (consider potential data leakage)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BYTES

Init_Win_bytes_forward	Init_Win_bytes_backward
- there refer to the initial tcp window size advertised by each side of the connection (client -> server -> client)
- they indicate how much data each side is willing to recieve before requiring acknoledgement 
-! large or unusual values can sometimes correlate with abnormal traffic or poor connections
-? this is not explicitly a sign of a dos attack and we should consider what the data looks like to see if we should remove this feature

act_data_pkt_fwd
- represents how many packets sent in the forward direction actually contains meaningful data
- represents data from users without the noise
-? if act data represents the data without the noise what kind of data is being sent when a dos attack is happening? 

Subflow Bwd Bytes   Subflow Fwd Bytes 
- these capture the total number of bytes sent forward vs backward within the session or flow
- this gives a sens of traffic inbalance 
-! dos attacks often heav heavy outbound packet volume wit hvery little legitimate response traffic
--- by replacing both subflow collumn with the difference we can have a better understanding on disporportionate samples

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKETS

fwd bwd data
{
Total Fwd Packets
- the total number of packets sent from the source to the destination during the connection
- it reflects how active the sende was

Total Backward Packets
- the total number of packets sent from the destination back to the source
- this shows how much response traffic there was

Total Length of Fwd Packets	
- the combined size (in bytes) of all packets sent forward
- it tells you how much actual data was trasmitted in that direction

Total Length of Bwd Packets	
- the combined size of all packets sent backward
- the total data that  was returned

--- this group of data can also be refactored to determine if there is a large difference between fwd and bwd
-! we will be expecting a disproportionate low response to sent data if there is a dos attack

}

packet measurements
{
Fwd Packet Length Max	Fwd Packet Length Min	Fwd Packet Length Mean	Fwd Packet Length Std	
Bwd Packet Length Max	Bwd Packet Length Min	Bwd Packet Length Mean	Bwd Packet Length Std

-! attack traffic will be small and repetitive, unusually large, or have low variation
-! low variation can be a sign of bots sending identical packets for a flooding attack
}

traffic speed
{
Fwd Packets/s	Bwd Packets/s

- the speed the source and the destination data are being sent
-! signs of a dos attack
    - forward rate is extremely high
    - bwd rate is near 0
}

packet length measurements
{
- describe the joined source and destination packet measurement data (smallest,largest,mean,std packet in the session)
Min Packet Length	Max Packet Length	Packet Length Mean	Packet Length Std	

Packet Length Variance	
-! you can think of it as squared standard deviation
-! low variance can be seen as bots sending identical data
-! high variance can be seen as malformed and mixed size flood packets
}


Average Packet Size
- average of all packet sizes 
- large average apcket size can be seen as mmore data heavy transactions
- small average size can is more common in dos attacks due to repetitive traffic

packat subflow{
Subflow Fwd Packets
- represents the total number of packets sent forward from source to desitnation within the subflow
- helps indicate how much the sender is pusing data or requests 

Subflow Bwd Packets
- this is thhe totla number of packets from destination to source is in the subflow
- indicates the servers response traffic

- all provide a snapshot for the volume of packets in each direction 
- shows how alanced the communcation is
-! whether the communication looks normal(back n forth) or attack like(one sided)

| Pattern                                     | Meaning                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High forward packets + low backward packets | Client flooding server (potential DoS)                         |
| Balanced forward/backward                   | Typical conversation (normal web traffic, file transfer, etc.) |
| Small packet sizes repeated rapidly         | Possible bot or automated attack traffic                       |
| Mixed sizes with structured responses       | Likely normal behavior                                         |

- all represent the timing metrics and can represent how smooth or chaotic the data is being communicated

Flow IAT Mean
- average time between packets
Flow IAT Std
- how the timing varies between packets	
Flow IAT Max	
- longest pause between any two packets
