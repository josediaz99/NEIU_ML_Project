based on the features we expect to be important and the features that were actually found to be important
using this information we can gain some insight on what is important to track

initially our destination port was the most important feature but there is no reason for
a category to hold so much weight especially when we know this feature should hold no weight

when using this we get different important features with different weights

feature 2 total backward packets
- this is an improtant feature to track in order to understand if we are sending a protportionate amount of information back to the users
- what is especially important to track is the ratio between forward and back packets in order to determine if the messeges being sent need to be sent back
-! to solve this lacking data we can use feature 2 and 3 and create a new column to represent if the disporportionate data flow
feature 3 total length fwd packets 
- tells us how much actuall data was sent forward 
- the feature is important to track how much data is being sent forward because we can expect the data to be very large when being flooded

new feature 
 Total Fwd Packets / total backward packets -> fwd bwd packet ratio 

feature 5 fwd packet length 
- because we know how some attacks work we expect when we recieve an abnormaly large  packet we can
find attacks
- we can leave this as is

feature 11 bwd packet length mean & 12 bwd packet length std
- these features tell us about how we send data back to the users / potential attacker
- we can expect this information to have low std and mean length 
- we can remove one of these features to classify attacks without suffering from a lack of data

feature 13 flow IAT mean
- this feature represents the average amount of time we spend between packets

feature 27 fwd header length
- unsure how this data can determine if we have an attacker

feature 31 min packet length 
- min packet length lacks the conext on who this is being sent from
- we expect the destination port to send back small to no info due to the attacks overwhelming the system
instead of ths we need to use bwd and fwd data to determine if this is unusual

feature 45 init win bytes backward
because this feature sometimes is correlated with poor connection i will remove this feature to prevent false possitives from a connection error

feature 46  act data pck frd
- this feature is important to track because it represents how much actual meaningful information is being sent forward to the destination port
